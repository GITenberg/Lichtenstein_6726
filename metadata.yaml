description: "Lichtenstein is a historical novel by Wilhelm Hauff, first published\
  \ in 1826, the year before his early death. Set in and around Württemberg, it is\
  \ considered his greatest literary success next to his fairy-tales, and, together\
  \ with the work of the almost forgotten Benedikte Naubert, represents the beginning\
  \ of historical novel-writing in Germany.\nHauff follows Sir Walter Scott (and Naubert)\
  \ by allowing an invented figure in a real family, Georg Sturmfeder, to witness\
  \ the events during the struggle of Ulrich von Württemberg against the Swabian League\
  \ under Georg, Truchsess von Waldburg-Zeil, who plays the part of foil to the positively\
  \ depicted Georg von Frundsberg. Hauff idealises Ulrich as a wronged man, who, in\
  \ his moment of need, is restored to his rights through the efforts of his people,\
  \ symbolised by the character of the Piper of Hardt. The historical Ulrich is remembered\
  \ largely for his exorbitant taxes on meat, wine and fruit, which provoked the Armer\
  \ Konrad peasant uprising of 1514, quelled only with the help of his enemy the Steward\
  \ of Waldburg-Zeil.\nLichtenstein was a romantic and patriotic German's tribute\
  \ to the work of Walter Scott. No foreign author was more popular than Scott in\
  \ the Germany of the early 19th century. His novels, translated in full, were so\
  \ generally read that it was said that the soil of old Scotland was more familiar\
  \ to Germans than their native land. Yet the hills of Scotland, Hauff said, were\
  \ not of a richer green than the German Harz, the waves of the Tweed were no bluer\
  \ than those of the Danube, Scotch men were no braver, Scotch women no lovelier\
  \ than the old Swabians and Saxons. Lichtenstein, modelled after the Waverley Novels,\
  \ was a direct protest against the novel with a foreign historical background and\
  \ was an attempt to recreate the romance of a bit of Swabian history as Scott had\
  \ done for the country of Ivanhoe and Waverley.\nThe great success of the book prompted\
  \ the rebuilding of Lichtenstein Castle in 1840–1842. The 1846 opera of the same\
  \ name by Peter Josef von Lindpaintner is based on this novel.\n From Wikipedia\
